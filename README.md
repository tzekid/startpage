# muh startpage

I started to feel that the Momentumâ„¢ extension slowly started getting
bloated. Maybe that's because I've been hanging out with the GNU/Linux crowd
too much latelyâ€¦

I use [Change New Tab](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/change-new-tab/mocklpfdimiadpbgamlgehpgpodggahe)
for Chrome. I dunno about
[Firefox](https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/7d4nto/how_do_you_select_a_custom_url_as_your_new_tab/dpv7iax/).

Anyhow, dis here be a simple startpage with the following 'features' and todos:

[x] page is lightweight[^1]  
[x] shows date, time and greets you  
[x] links to **my** most used sites  

[^1]: page loads in under 50ms on my machine. right now it is ~30ms w/o cache.

Feel free to steal it, but don't forget to share your versions with me ðŸ˜‰.  
If you have any ideas or improvements feel free to open an issue.
